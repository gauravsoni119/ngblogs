        <p><strong>Isolated scopes</strong> are heavily used in angular directives to make directives resuable. By default directives
            access scope of their parent. Changing value in directives changes value in parent scope. We can define scopes
            in directives in three ways:-
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Set scope property in directives to false(default value of directives) which allows to use scope of their parent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set scope property in directives to true which allows to create their own scope by using prototypical inheritance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set scope property to an object with '@'(attribute binding), '='(two way binding) and '&'(expression binding).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We disscuss bellow about last one i.e binding properties of directives.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>@: Attribute Binding</h3>
                <p>Attribute binding allow directives to simply pass value from parent scope to directives scope. This is one-way
                    binding. Changes value in directives will not change value in parent.</p>

            <li>
                <h3>=: Two way binding</h3>
                <p>Two way binding allow to pass value from parent scope to directives scope and from directives scope to parent
                    scope. Changes value in directives will also change value in parent.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>&: Expression binding</h3>
                <p>Expression binding allow to call expression or function in parent scope from directives scope. We can pass
                    value from directives to parent by using expression binding. In bellow code, we pass message from directive
                    to parent scope by passing message object in <strong>userClick</strong>.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>Isolated scopes are really very poweful feature of angularJs. They allow us to reduce redundency in code by their
            reusable nature. </p>
