        <p><strong>Controller</strong> is a javacript object which contains application logic. It is a constructor function used to prepare data for views.
It contains objects, properties, functions and expose data to the view.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scope</strong> is responsible for updating value in view and from view updating value back to controller. We can say that it acts like a glue or an intermediator
between controller and view. It resides in browser's memory. It is directly accessible to view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever angular finds <strong>ng-controller</strong> directive on DOM element in view/template, it creates a context(or boundary) which is only available to that element
and elements inside it. Outside of it no one can access that context. Also at this time, angular creates instance of controller and merge it with scope.

        <p>In the above example, div and any elements inside div can access emp controller. The context of emp controller is inside div.
Scope creates instance of controller emp and merge it into them. That's why we can access name in the view.</p>
        <p>We know that scope is directly accessible to view and scope merged controller instance into it. So now all three are interconnected.
Whenever view updates model, scope gets notified which updates value in controller and vice-versa.</p>
