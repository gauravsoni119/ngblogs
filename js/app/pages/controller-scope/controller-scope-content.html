        <p><strong>Controller</strong> are the javacript objects which contains application logic. It is a constructor function used to prepare data for views.
It contains objects, properties, functions and expose data to the view.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scope</strong> is responsible for updating value in view and from view updating data back to controller. We can say that it acts like a glue or an intermediator
between controller and view. It resides in browser's memory. It is directly accessible to view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever angular finds <strong>ng-controller</strong> directive on DOM element in view/template, it creates a context(or boundary) which is only available to that element
and elements inside it. Outside of it no one can access that context. Also at this time, angular creates instance of controller and merge it with scope.

        <p>We know that scope is directly accessible to view and scope merged controller instance into it. So now all three are interconnected.
Whenever view updates model, scope gets notified which updates value in controller and vice-versa.</p>
