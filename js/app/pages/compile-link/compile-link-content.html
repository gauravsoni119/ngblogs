        <p><strong>Compile</strong> is the first phase of angularJs directive. While compiling, angularJs creates copy of the
            DOM or HTML string and trying to creates template instance of it. Here we can only access elements and attributes
            . AngularJs compiles directive only once. For example, if we use directive with ng-repeat, then our directive compiles
            only once.<br>We can style our elements or update values in attributes, but this is not a safe place to update
            because we have here raw string of HTML or DOM. For updating style, attributes we have link function. AngularJs
            provides compile function inside directive in order to get control over compile process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Points to remember:- </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If directive has further child directives, then angularJs also compiles that directives before jumping into
                    next process.</li>
                <li>If we use compile function, then our link function will never executes.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Linking</strong> is the next step at which we have access to template instance created in compile process.
            In linking process, controller of directive firstly executes. In controller, data is initialized
            and scope is created. After that pre function of link executes. This function executes before child elements
            are linked. This is not safe for DOM manipulations.<br> After pre function executes, the very next post function
            of link executes. This executes after all child elements are linked. In post function, we have access to elements,
            attributes, scope and controller. This is safe for DOM manipulations. After the post function executes, angularJs
            renders the DOM.

            In the above example, firstly compile function of dir1 and then compile function of dir2 executes.
            After this controller and pre link function of dir1 and then dir2 executes.
            In the last, post function of dir2 and then dir1 executes. Post function always runs in opposite direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Points to remember:- </strong> If directive has further child directives, then angularJs calls controller
            and pre function of all directives from parent to child(top to bottom). After done with these two function, all
            post functions from child to parent(bottom to top) are executed.
